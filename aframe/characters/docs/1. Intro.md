# Goal

Load the models from [Kenney's Character Assets](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-character-assets) with animations into A-Frame and useable in in WebVR.

## Problem 1 - Format
The models from Kenney are in [FBX Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX). This is very common format, unfortunately not one that works well with A-Frame. We need a the model in [GLTF Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF).

Before we can load models into A-Frame, we should have a base understanding of how to load 3D models with Three.JS. [Recommended Intro](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models)

**So how do we convert the file to our desired format?**

In the past I have loaded the model into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and then used that to export the model to [GLTF Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF). I've had mixed results with this process and it takes quite a bit of time per model.

Instead, Let's make a tool to convert the models.

I'll use the [FBXLoader](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/loaders/FBXLoader.js) to create an FBX Loader for A-Frame.

There is an existing FBX Loader in [Don McCurdy's A-frame extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders). So if you just want a good way to load FBX Files in a-frame, go with his version. The one I am going to create will not have all the features. I'm only going to implement enough to convert to our desired GLTF format.
