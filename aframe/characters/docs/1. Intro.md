# Goal

Load the models from [Kenney's Character Assets](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-character-assets) with animations into A-Frame and useable in in WebVR.

## Problem 1 - Format
The models from Kenney are in [FBX Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX). This is very common format, unfortunately not one that works well with A-Frame. We need a the model in [GLTF Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF).

Before we can load models into A-Frame, we should have a base understanding of how to load 3D models with Three.JS. [Recommended Intro](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models)

**So how do we convert the file to our desired format?**

In the past I have loaded the model into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and then used that to export the model to [GLTF Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF). I've had mixed results with this process and it can take quite a bit of time per model. It depends on how the model was exported.

I started to make an [fbx-model component](./fbx-model-component.md), but gave up after the first error. It was not a problem I want to spend time on since Blender works so well.
