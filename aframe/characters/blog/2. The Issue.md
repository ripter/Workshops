# The Issue

The `material` component, along with others, makes use of `.getObject3D('mesh')` to get the [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) object.

The [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) is an object with `.geometry` and `.material` properties.





---

If you want to apply material to an imported model, the default `material` component assumes the [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) is set

If we look at the [gltf-model source](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/src/components/gltf-model.js#L31-L34), we can see that `mesh` is set to the root scene object.
