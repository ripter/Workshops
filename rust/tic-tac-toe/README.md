# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe state

Rust code compiled to WASM for use by JavaScript. Create a new object with new_game() and pass it into the wasm functions to get the state for that game.

```js
// Create a new game state
const gameState = wasm.new_game();
// gameState.step_number
// gameState.winner
// gameState.is_x_next

// Get the current game board as an array of numbers.
const boardU8 = wasm.get_board(gameState);
// Get the board as an array of letters.
const boardChar = Array.from(wasm.get_board(gameState)).map(u8 => String.fromCharCode(u8)),


// Mark a square
wasm.set_mark(gameState, squareIndex);

// Rewind to a previous step.
wasm.rewind(gameState, newStep);
```
